This is a reading group centered around category theory and associated parts of math.

Books:

- [Category Theory, by Steve Awodey [PDF]](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/courses/catlogic/awodey.pdf)
  
  Minimal prerequisites, explains most things from the ground up.

- [Basic Category Theory, by Tom Leinster [PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375v1)

  More mathematical background necessary (particularly in algebra and topology).
  
Other links:

- [ncatlab](https://ncatlab.org)

  A good reference for everything related to category theory
  
- [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)

  If you are a programmer, this will ground category theory in solid examples.

- [TheCatsters](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters)

  A questionably good youtube channel (haven't looked much at it)
  
- [Patrick Stevens](https://www.patrickstevens.co.uk/)

  This guy has a lot of cool stuff on his website, not organized terribly well though. If you search for "awodey", you'll see a bunch of posts where he goes through his understanding of some of the Awodey chapters.
