On Sunday from 5-6 we had our first meeting.

Summary:

- We are planning to meet 3-4pm every Sunday.

- We are going to start by catching up on basic category theory so everybody is on
  the same page, ~~but we are going to move to following a series of lecture notes
  from a class taught at Cornell after the first couple weeks.~~
  This was the original plan, but ultimately we decided to do a "top down"
  approach, wherein we pick a larger topic such as "haskell optics", look up their
  category theoretic definition, and work towards understanding that piece by
  piece.

- We are going to communicate via a Slack chat, which will be set up soon.
  UPDATE: the chat is readermonad.slack.com.

- For the first week, everyone should read about categories, functors, and
  universal mapping properties, specifically products and coproducts, and bring
  in their favorite example of any of these for next time.
